	!There are only two rooms that you can go to, shouldn't be too hard bumbling your way thru this.
	!There is an obvious locked door on the right side, perhaps that would work?
	!While mildy entertaining, just asking for it to be unlocked isn't going to work.
	!You are not going to find a key for it.
	!Nor does Guybrush know how to pick locks.
	!That only leaves the option of using force.
	!Suffice to say, but Guybrush isn't strong enough to bash down the door on his own.
	!The cannon has a lot of force...
	!...what with all that recoil.
	$GetBitVar(168)
		!Use the cannon again.
	$!GetBitVar(167)
		!Too bad that it is in use.
		!<link ref="whatSayWally">Talk to the pirate</link> and see if you can convince him to let you use the cannon.

		!Try using the cannon.
	!But the cannon is securely tied to the wall.
	$HasItem(335)
		!Use the sword to cut the rope.
	!If only you had something to cut the rope with.
	!Did you check the debree that floated to the ship after your cannon firing?
	!There is something useful floating outside.

		!Use the rod+hook combo to pick up the debree.

		!The loading rod is long enough.
		!But it doesn't catch on to the debree.
		!Perhaps you could improve it?

		!That diamond ring could prove useful.
		!Ever heard of Mohs scale?
		!It says that diamonds are the hardest thing.
		!Hard enough to cut anything.
		!Including cutting glass.
		!Like say, the glass in the small porthole on the wall.
		!Use the diamon ring with the porthole.
	!Surely there has to be something useful here.

		!Pick up the bag.
	!That is one big diamond ring.
	!Pick it up.
